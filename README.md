<h2> Project Description </h2>

<p>
The AbleGo project aims to improve accessible ride-hailing for people with disabilities. It is a mobile app designed specifically for individuals with disabilities, allowing them to easily book rides. The app includes features like indicating specific disabilities, booking rides via phone calls, using voice commands, selecting wheelchair-accessible vehicles, receiving on/off-boarding assistance, and communicating with drivers using sign language. AbleGo also offers a PayLater service for convenient payments. By addressing the challenges faced by people with disabilities and collaborating with disability organizations, the project aims to achieve social and economic success. The application will be launched in a specific area, gathering feedback for continuous enhancements. The project also plans to train drivers in assisting individuals with disabilities and expand the user base by integrating with other ride-hailing apps. Overall, the implementation of AbleGo will greatly benefit society and the disabled community.
